### [Feature Space Singularity for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14654) 

We propose a simple yet effective algorithm named FSSD based on a novel observation: in a trained neural network, OoD samples with bounded norms well concentrate in the feature space. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on various OoD detection benchmark and enjoys robustness to slight corruption in test data.
