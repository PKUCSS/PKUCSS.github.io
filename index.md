I am Sishuo Chen (ÈôàÊÄùÁ°ï), an ML engineer at Alimama, China's largest online advertising platform, which is affiliated to Alibaba. 

I received my master's degree in computer science from Peking University in 2024, directed by Prof. [Xu Sun](https://xusun26.github.io/) at the [LANCO](https://lancopku.github.io/) group. 
Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science and a double bachelor‚Äôs degree in economics from Peking University in 2021.

Currently, I am working on the research topics covering conversion rate esitimation and multimodal natural language processing.
My reserach interests also cover large language models(LLMs) and trustworthy machine learning.
Please feel free to chat ^_^
